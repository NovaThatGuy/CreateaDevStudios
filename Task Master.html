        <div class="common-box">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is Task Master?</h3>
            <p>First of all Task Master is a placeholder name for the Android application we are working on. However Task Master is a fairly fitting name as the application's purpose is to track and log a user's tasks. They can sort tasks by importance and set when tasks will move to being more important if they are left undone for a set period of time. The progress of Task Master will be publically available through Github soon, if you are interested in seeing it's progress feel free to check it out there.</p>

            <h3>Devlog Report: 3</h3>
            <h4>Date: 9/15/23</h4>
            <p>Managed to get the application working again. It's still fairly early on but it does technically work which is a good start. Next steps will be to get it to display tasks in 3 different columns based on importance, as of now they are already seperated by importance but it's as a single column that is just labeld off to diffrientiate which is which part.</p>
            <h3>Devlog Report: 2</h3>
            <h4>Date: 9/13/23</h4>
            <p>So far we've managed to get the basics of the program somewhat working, we've been met with challenges involving Kivy and Python not wanting to work together on key points. This should be managable and with some testing and debugging. As we stand now the basics such as task importance and simply writing the task are functional (when Kivy lets them work). Until we find a fix for the core problem the program cannot grow much as we can't test or keep building off something that wont even work half the time due to some unknown communication error between Python and Kivy. For the sake of transparency here is the error we are at now "AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute '__getattr__'. Did you mean: '__setattr__'?"</p>
            <h3>Devlog Report: 1</h3>
            <h4>Date: 9/12/23</h4>    
            <p>Today will mark the start of development on Task Master.</p>
