        <div class="common-box">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why should you hire us?</h2>
            <p>We may be a small group, but you don't need a large organization for everything. Our smaller scale operation gives us flexability and more room to ensure customer satisfaction. One massive benefit of working with us is you will be dealing with actual people, we have the freedom to be down to earth and friendly with clients, you wont have to deal with some prescripted dreadfully dull workers, that only care about getting the sale. With us, we are simply looking to help you out however we can.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What do we do?</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Web Devlopment</h4>
            <p>We can do almost any type of Website you'd like and will even help you in deciding how to build the site, how to get a domain for the site, and anything else you could need for the site.</p>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Software Development</h4>
            <p>We can do many different types of programs and appliations, though our capabilities are limited by our smaller scale. We can't make anything that would normally require a large company, so no large scale video games, advanced self learning AIs, etc. However if you need a custom web scraping application, a data analysis program, etc; we can do that, reach out to us if you have any questions or want to see if we can make the application you need.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">How much does it cost to hire us?</h3>
            <p>Put simply, we charge based on the scale of the job. We try to give as fair a price as possible, even to the extent of undercutting ourselves at times. We do offer <b>Free</b> services from time to time, though this depends on a few factors which we will go over below. If you'd like to get a quote on the work you need done, you can contact us at <u>createadevstudios@gmail.com</u> and we will get back to you ASAP.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Free Work</h3>
            <p>We only offer to work for free on particular kinds of jobs. We only offer to work for free after having gone over what all work needs to be done, we will handle this during the quote. The following are examples of circumstances that may lead to us offering free service: being for a nonprofit or charity, being a job that could be completed in a short period of time, or being an initial smaller job that would help decide if a client would rehire us for something else.</p>
